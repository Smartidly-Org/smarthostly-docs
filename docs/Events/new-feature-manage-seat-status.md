## New Feature: Manage Seat Status

We're excited to introduce a much-needed feature that allows you to self-manage the blocking and unblocking of seats directly through the Hub. This new functionality is designed to give you more control over your event seating arrangements with ease.

### What Can You Do?

* **Block or Unblock Seats**: From now on, you can block or unblock seats directly using the “Manage Seat Status” option within the Hub.
* **Manage Only Unblocked Seats**: Please note that seats that are already booked or reserved by users cannot be modified through this feature.
* **Restricted Changes**: Previously blocked seats by our team cannot be altered here. Only new changes that you make through this window will be managed.

This feature is intended to help you seamlessly manage your operations, taking you one step further in ensuring a smooth event experience.

### How to Use the "Manage Seat Status" Feature

1. **Navigating to the Manage Seat Status Option**:
   To begin managing your seat statuses, navigate to the seat map within your event settings. You'll find the "Manage Seat Status" button prominently displayed. See the screenshot below for reference.

2. **Using the Seat Status Modal**:
   Once you click on "Manage Seat Status," a modal window will appear where you can select the seat number, view its current status, and choose the new status (either Blocked or Unblocked). This is how the screen looks:

   * **Current Status**: Displays the current state of the seat (e.g., Available, Blocked).
   * **New Status**: Choose to either Block or Unblock the seat.
   * **Fetch Status**: If you need to verify a seat's status before making changes, use this option.
   * **Update Status**: Once you're ready, simply click this button to apply your changes.

### Important Notes

* **Avoid Peak Booking Hours**: Caution is advised when changing seat statuses during peak booking times to avoid conflicts.
* **Only New Changes**: Only the new changes made through this window will be managed. Previously blocked seats by us cannot be altered here.

We hope this feature enhances your ability to manage your event seating with greater flexibility and efficiency. All of this can be done within just a few minutes!
