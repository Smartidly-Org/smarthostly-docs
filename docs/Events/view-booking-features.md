# How to view your bookings

# Viewing Bookings

The Smarthostly **View Bookings** feature allows admins to view, filter, and customize booking data for events. This documentation outlines how to navigate and use the feature effectively.

## Overview

On the bookings page, you can see an overview of the event's bookings, including:

- **Total Bookings**: Displays the total number of bookings.
- **Total Tickets Sold**: Shows the total count of tickets sold.
- **Total Amount**: The total revenue generated from bookings, shown in the local currency (e.g., SEK).

Example URL for accessing the bookings page (IDs will vary per event and show):


Replace `<Event-ID>`, `<Show-ID>`, and `<Show-Name>` with the specific identifiers for the event you are viewing.

## Booking Table

The main section displays a table with booking details. Each row represents a booking with the following columns:

- **S.No.**: Serial number of the booking.
- **Booking ID**: Unique identifier for each booking.
- **Bookie Details**: Includes first name, last name, email, and contact number.
- **Ticket Category**: The type and category of tickets booked (e.g., Adult, Child).
- **Food Preferences**: Number of veg and non-veg food items selected.
- **Booking Time**: Timestamp of when the booking was made.
- **Ticket Count** and **Total Amount**: Number of tickets and total amount for each booking.

## Customizing Columns

To customize the table display:

1. Click on the **Edit Columns** button located above the table.
2. Select or deselect columns from the dropdown to show or hide specific information.
3. The choices include:
   - **# of Tickets**
   - **Total Amount (SEK)**
   - **CheckedIn Status**
   - **Seating Status**
   - **Seats Allocation**
   - Various ticket categories (e.g., "GTS Member (Adult)", "Non GTS Member (Child)").

This allows for flexible viewing depending on the data needed.

Downloading Booking Data
To download the booking data:

Click the Download button to export the table data in a CSV or Excel format, making it easy to analyze or share booking data externally.
Tips for Effective Use
Use the Edit Columns feature to focus on key metrics or information relevant to your analysis. For example, if you only need financial data, select only Total Amount and # of Tickets.

Ensure sensitive data, such as personal contact details, is handled in compliance with data privacy regulations when exporting or sharing booking data.
