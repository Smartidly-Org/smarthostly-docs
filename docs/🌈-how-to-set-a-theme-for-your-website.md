title: 🌈 How to Set a Theme for Your Website
---


This guide will help you configure and publish a visual theme using the Theme Editor. Once done, your website or app will reflect your selected colors and styles.

---

## ✅ What is this for?

The **Theme Editor** lets you define how your website looks—colors, background, buttons, cards, borders, and more. You can create themes for **Light** or **Dark** mode and apply them to specific apps or platforms.

---

## 🛠 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. **Choose the Theme Type**
Select either `Light` or `Dark` from the dropdown at the top.  
This determines whether you’re editing styles for bright or dark mode.

### 2. **Name Your Theme**
Enter a short and clear name in the **Theme Name** field (example: `Mode 1`).  
This helps you identify and manage themes later.

### 3. **Set the Visual Styles**
Fill in the fields under the selected theme (Light or Dark). Here's what each one means:

| Field | What It Controls |
|-------|------------------|
| **Primary** | Your brand or main action color (buttons, links). |
| **Primary Foreground** | The text or icon color on top of the primary color. |
| **Secondary** | A supporting color, used for secondary buttons or highlights. |
| **Secondary Foreground** | Text or icons shown on secondary backgrounds. |
| **Muted** | A soft or subtle background used for less prominent areas. |
| **Muted Foreground** | Text shown on muted backgrounds. |
| **Accent** | A highlight color used to draw attention (e.g. selected tab). |
| **Accent Foreground** | Text or icons shown on accent areas. |
| **Destructive** | Used for warnings or delete buttons. |
| **Destructive Foreground** | Text on top of destructive areas. |
| **Card** | Background color for cards, panels, or grouped content. |
| **Card Foreground** | Text or icons inside cards. |
| **Popover** | Background for popups, tooltips, or menus. |
| **Popover Foreground** | Text inside popups or menus. |
| **Border** | The color of lines, separators, or borders. |
| **Input** | The background of input fields like text boxes or dropdowns. |
| **Ring** | The outline that appears when clicking or focusing elements. |
| **Radius** | How round the corners should be (e.g. 0.5rem for slightly rounded). |
| **Background** | The overall page background color. |
| **Foreground** | The default text color across the page. |

💡 You only need to fill out the fields under the theme you are working with (Light or Dark). You can click the **+ Add** button under Dark to define a dark version of the same theme if needed.

### 4. **Assign to a Host**
In the **Host ID** field at the bottom, enter the app or website this theme should apply to.  
For example, enter `IMGV` to assign it to the IMGV platform.

---

### 5. **Save and Publish**
- Click **Save** (top right corner) to store your changes.
- Then click **Publish** to make your theme go live.

> ⚠️ Saving alone does not apply the theme—you must **Publish** for users to see the new design.
